# Welcome To My React Portfolio Repository!

# Specifically this Repo is for the Frontend of the app

This project includes only the front end of my portfolio app. I have split up the front end and back end to get the app ready for production. I have a repository that has both frontend and backend all in one which was built during development. If you want to clone this app then head over to my Portfolio-React repo to se the code!

This project includes the following

- Multiple page React.js application
- Links to and information about previous projects
- Animations using a range of libraries

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to start the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. As this project connects to gmail to send emails and the OpenAI API you will need to include these credentials yourself to get it to work with those elements.
If you are wanting the email and GPT functionality to work you will need to open and run the backend of the code as well. Head over to my repository for the backend of my portfolio to see how to do that!
